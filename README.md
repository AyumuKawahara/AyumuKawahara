- 🧑‍💻 I'm a software engineer.
- 🌱 I’m good at Typescript, especially with Next.js!
- I am majoring in Computer Science at Osaka University and recently started working independently as an engineer. In addition to engineering, I often handle tasks like copywriting and design. My motto is to build high-quality user experiences, and my strength lies in focusing on the finer details to create elevated customer experiences. Every service I develop stands out with features like rhyming taglines, pixel-perfect attention to whitespace, lightning-fast page loads, and overall sleek aesthetics. Nice to meet you!
